## The project

This project was a challenge by Alura, and it was developed in 4 weeks through december'21 and january'22. The goal is to create an online code editor that is able to share user projects in a community. My extra goals were to implement SSR and Hybrid Data Fetching with Next.js, expand my testing skills with playwright, and to learn firebase auth, firestore and recoil!

## The highlights

The most valuable lessons I learned with this project were:

- Client only components with Next.js and dynamic loading them;
- Firebase authentication procedures;
- How ease to use Recoil is;
- How to invalidate SSR data using Hybrid Fetching;
- How much I still have to learn with e2e testing.

npm i -g pnpm
